<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Mohan Dravid R, a curious learner and a Data Science student in an integrated MSc program. I enjoy exploring how logic, code, and data come together to solve real-world problems. At the same time, I’m also fascinated by biology and how computational tools can help us understand human evolution and disease patterns. I love learning new things and pushing myself to get better every day.</p>

<p>But I’m not just about academics — I’m deeply passionate about filmmaking and storytelling. I love cinema, especially Tamil films, and I see stories everywhere. Whether it’s writing scripts, analyzing movies, or thinking about how to create engaging content, I’m always dreaming big. I also have an interest in business and content creation, and I’m working on building something meaningful in those areas too.</p>

<p>My biggest dream is to make a mark in filmmaking and storytelling. I’m not just a fan of cinema — I want to create it. I enjoy writing, building narratives, and imagining scenes that can move people. Even though I come from a data science background, I see that as a strength — blending logic with emotion, tech with art. One day, I want to direct films that inspire, entertain, and leave an impact. Everything I’m doing now — from learning to building discipline — is a step toward that vision.</p>
