I’m Mohan Dravid R, a curious learner and a Data Science student in an integrated MSc program. I enjoy exploring how logic, code, and data come together to solve real-world problems. At the same time, I’m also fascinated by biology and how computational tools can help us understand human evolution and disease patterns. I love learning new things and pushing myself to get better every day.

But I’m not just about academics — I’m deeply passionate about filmmaking and storytelling. I love cinema, especially Tamil films, and I see stories everywhere. Whether it’s writing scripts, analyzing movies, or thinking about how to create engaging content, I’m always dreaming big. I also have an interest in business and content creation, and I’m working on building something meaningful in those areas too.

Right now, I’m on a journey of personal transformation. I’m trying to be more consistent, wake up early, stay focused, hit the gym, and remove distractions that don’t serve me. I believe in becoming the best version of myself, one step at a time. I know I have a long way to go — but I’m ready for it.

Right now, I’m in a phase where I really want to level up — not just in skills, but in discipline and mindset. I’m pushing myself to be more consistent, wake up early, stay away from distractions like porn, focus on my goals, hit the gym, and stick to a daily routine. It’s not easy, but I’ve decided to give myself one last serious shot to become who I truly want to be. I want to live with purpose, and every day is a step toward that version of me.
